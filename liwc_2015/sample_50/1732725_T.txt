I'm Gabrielle Kivitz from Deutsche Bank; very pleased this morning to introduce VF Corp. This company, I think, has been a real standout, putting up some very solid performance in a particularly tough environment. So, I think they deserve some credit for that. With us today from the Company we have Eric Wiseman, the Company's CEO; we have Bob Shearer, the Company's CFO, and Cindy Knoebel, the Head of Investor Relations. So with that, I will turn it over to Eric.
