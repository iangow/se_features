Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2006 Praxair Incorporated earnings conference call. My name is Shanique and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. If at any time during the call you require assistance, please key star followed by zero and a coordinator will be happy to assist you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Sawyer, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir.
