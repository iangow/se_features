Thank you and good afternoon to everyone. Present on our call today is Mark Crossman, our President and CEO; and Hamish Sandhu, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we start, let me review the Company's Safe Harbor language.
  During the course of this call certain statements made today may contain forward-looking statements. Statements of the Company's or management's intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different.
  You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates they are made. I will also refer you to our reports that are filed with the SEC including our 10-K and 10-Qs on a periodic basis. These documents include information that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any projections which may be made during the course of this conference call.
  And by making the forward-looking statements today, we undertake no obligation to update them for revisions or changes after today's date. Finally, a copy of our earnings release and a recording of this call will be available on our website, www.Innovogroup.com, and a telephone replay will be available also for one week from today. With that, I will turn the call over to Marc.
