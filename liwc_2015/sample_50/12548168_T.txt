Thank you. And there are no further questions here.
 And as there are no further questions, I'll now put the resolution displayed on the screen to the meeting. Mr. Paul Rayner, being a director who retires under the board's policy on annual election and being eligible for reappointment, is reelected as a director of the company. Details of the proxies received on Paul Rayner's reelection are now shown on the screen which you can see. Please now record your vote on Item 2G on your voting card if you have not already done so.
