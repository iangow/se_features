I would answer that by looking at each of our businesses. As I mentioned on the sensors business, we've been running at about 1.5 points on a consolidated basis, maybe 2 percentage points in terms of pricing down for many years now. And we really haven't veered from that. I don't think that's going to change right now.
 On the control side of the business, at least in the last couple of years, we've actually had pricing power, in large part because a lot of what our product -- maybe not a lot, but our products do contain metals, commodities like silver and gold and what have you, and we've been able to pass through price increases that are coming from those commodities on our customers. So to the extent that that stabilizes going forward in 2013 maybe there isn't price appreciation, but I wouldn't expect much pricedowns going forward on the controls side of the business either.
