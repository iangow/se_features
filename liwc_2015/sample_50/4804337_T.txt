I do think it varies a little bit, but I don't think the attitude has shifted dramatically. I do think -- certainly when you look at different parts of the world, the perspective is different. And when you're looking at emerging markets, most folks that own companies in emerging markets, which tend to be a vast majority of what we're looking at are privately family-held type companies, they're looking more of a -- okay, I think my company is going to be worth X in five or 10 years from now, so this is kind of the value I'm looking for, because there is a lot of growth in that market. So that perspective, I'm not sure that's changed at all. When you look at North America and Europe, I think most people have kind of accepted what today's reality is. The US has begun to -- has stabilized and begun to improve and showing signs of some positive move forward or positive recovery. I don't think that's changed folks' perspective on pricing. I will say that there's a lot more money in that area now and then there is certainly -- the capital markets and the financing markets are very strong right now. So the competitive nature for assets is certainly more intensive than it's been in quite some time in future.
