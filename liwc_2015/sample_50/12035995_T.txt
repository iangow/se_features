Thank you, Anil, and thanks to everyone for being on the call today. Before I open the call for your questions, I want to share a couple of closing thoughts. Over the past several months, I've had the chance to interact with our customers, vendors and manufacturing partners. In this short time, I have come away with several impressions, all of them leading me to an important conclusion, that we are in the initial stage of a world of complex antenna designs. Over the next several years, the need for higher wireless speeds will demand more sophisticated and complex antennas.
 In many ways, antennas are becoming the next frontier of end-to-end system performance improvement with magnitudes of improvement not being matched by other components in the industry. With that backdrop and Airgain's unique product offering and years of experience in solving difficult RF engineering problems, I am convinced that even brighter times are ahead for us.
 In conclusion, as we enter into 2019, we believe the company is in a much stronger position both on a competitive and execution front, and we are confident of achieving our goals of healthy growth along with profitability on a sustainable basis. And with that, we're ready to open the call for your questions.
 Operator, please provide us with the appropriate instructions.
