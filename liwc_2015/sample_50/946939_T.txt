Yeah, and we'll probably get into this a little bit in my presentation later, but we do use VaR, as most everybody does, but we also realize the limitations of value at risk and looking at a very diversified portfolio like what exists in the commodities group.
 So, we basically take a different approach to looking at the risk of the portfolio. And what we really do is do a lot of stress tests and scenario analyses where we stress both prices, customer loads and et cetera in multiple different market environments so we can understand the outcomes that they provide us.
 And so, and we then review those on a corporate consolidated basis. So while we look at it on the commodities group level, we also look at it on the enterprise group level because we want to understand the risk across the whole company because there are other natural offsets within our portfolio company that we have.
 So while we understand the risk and the business unit level, we also understand the enterprise level. So I'll talk about a little bit more of this later but also credit and we'll about that in my presentation as well, we actively manage our credit portfolio to avoid credit losses but also to permit the business that needs to be done to get the growth that we're looking for.
 And we've done that very successfully and we will continue to do that on an independent basis but work with each of the individual businesses to provide the risk to oversight that's necessary to ensure that we're managing the portfolio on a conservative and prudent basis within the tolerances that are set by the senior management of the company and the board of directors.
