Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2019. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contract up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and its nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value of our business -- the value our business generates.
 Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for a term license agreement at the end of each period, was approximately $526 million at the end of the third quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 9.7% on a year-over-year basis and 2.6% sequentially. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period less the value of term license contracts signed in the current period but where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under Topic 606 plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period, was $160 million, a 29% increase year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in bookings reflects a significant increase in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal as compared to the year ago period. As I mentioned earlier, bookings can fluctuate significantly between periods since it is driven, in large part, by the timing of when customer contracts are up for renewal. Year-to-date total bookings were $410.8 million, a 23% increase year-over-year.
 Total revenue was $148 million for the third quarter, a 16% increase from the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in revenue was a result of the increase in total bookings discussed above.
 Breaking revenue down by line item. License revenue, which represents a portion of a term license agreement allocated to the initial licenses, was $98.5 million, a 25% increase year-over-year. As mentioned earlier, the increase is the result of the higher amount of term license agreements coming up for renewal in the quarter as compared to the year ago period. Maintenance revenue, which represents a portion of the term license agreement related to ongoing support and the right to future enhancements, was $41.9 million, a 2% increase from the prior year period. Maintenance revenue is recognized on a daily ratable basis over the life of the term license contract and will grow more in line with our annual spend. Services and other revenue was $7.6 million, a 2% decline in the year ago period. The decline in services revenue was largely driven by the timing of projects.
 Turning to profitability beginning on a GAAP basis. Gross profit was $133.6 million in the quarter, with a gross margin of 90.3%, which compares to $115 million and a gross margin of 90% in the prior year period.
 Operating expenses for the quarter were $62.8 million compared to $61.4 million in the year ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue were $77.2 million, which was up from $74.1 million in the year ago period and $76.7 million last quarter.
 Operating income was $70.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $53.6 million in the year ago period. Net income for the quarter was $61.6 million or $0.88 per share compared to net income of $44.5 million or $0.61 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Interest income in the third quarter was $6.8 million, up from $6.3 million in the year ago period. Recall that under Topic 606, there is an implied financing component to our term license contracts. The imputed value of this financing component is taken from the license fees and recognized as interest income over the payment term.
 Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisition and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of $78.3 million, representing a 52.9% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $59.9 million and 46.9%, respectively in the year ago period. Non-GAAP net income was $67.5 million or $0.96 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 based on 70.2 million shares outstanding. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $49 million or $0.67 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 based on 72.7 million shares outstanding.
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. The company ended the quarter with $65.6 million in cash and marketable securities compared to $54.4 million at the end of last quarter. We ended the quarter with $220 million of debt drawn from our credit facility. As Antonio mentioned, during the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 800,000 shares of our stock for $75 million.
 Contract assets at the end of the third quarter were $673.5 million. Recall that this line item on the balance sheet under Topic 606 represents the portion of the initial license performance obligation that has been recognized in revenue but not invoiced. This is sometimes referred to as unbilled accounts receivable.
 From a cash flow perspective, we generated $90 million of cash from operations during the third quarter and $89.1 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software, litigation and acquisition-related payments.
 A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website.
 I would now like to close with guidance. Remember, that we will now only be providing guidance on an annual basis and providing directional commentary on the timing of annual spend and bookings during the year. We are increasing the guidance we provided on our fiscal second quarter earnings call. We now expect bookings in the range of $575 million to $600 million, which includes $398 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2019. This is an increase from our prior guidance of $565 million to $590 million. With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we're now forecasting 9.5% to 10% annual spend growth. We're also adjusting and tightening the guidance range for the APM business to 1.75 to 2.25 points. We now expect revenue in the range of $549 million to $569 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $356 million to $372 million. Maintenance revenue in the range of $166 million to $169 million and service and other revenue in the range of $27 million to $28 million.
 From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $309 million to $312 million. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in the range of $240 million to $257 million for fiscal 2019 with GAAP net income of approximately $217 million to $231 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.26. From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $272 million to $289 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $3.42 to $3.62. This compares to $268 million and $287 million and $3.37 to $3.60 previously. From a free cash flow perspective, we reiterate our guidance of $223 million to $228 million. Our fiscal 2019 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments of approximately $45 million to $50 million.
 In summary, we delivered strong financial and operational performance in the third quarter. The business is performing well and we are seeing a positive impact from the investments in our growth initiatives in recent quarters. We believe we are well positioned to continue delivering an attractive combination of growth and profitability that can generate sustained value for our shareholders. With that, we would now like to begin the Q&A. Operator?
