Our growth really comes down to a couple things. One is M&A. We still think that there is some M&A opportunities both in terms of Canada and here in the United States, and that will continue to drive growth. We look at M&A in a very disciplined way. It has to meet some very specific hurdles before we'll do it.
 Two, if you look at the independent channel, we sell just about every independent retailer in North America, including Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico. So the only way for us to increase our business with them is SKU extension. So specialty cheese, hormone-free, antibiotic-free protein is our growth vehicle for increasing our business in the independent channel.
 The supermarket channel is basically using our existing contracts where we only sell a portion of the demand. So maybe we only sell natural and organic, we'll sell specialty, maybe we only sell specialty, we'll sell natural and organic, but the biggest driver is continued client wins. And so the bulk of our growth in terms of sheer dollars is going to continue to come from the conventional retail.
