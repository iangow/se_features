Okay, Rich, thanks. So to recap, we are pleased with our 2016 performance and we're confident in our ability to meet or exceed our 2017 growth objectives. Demand for our iStent technology remains strong, driven by an expanding base of fully-trained and implanting surgeons, a growing body of compelling real-world clinical results, and reimbursement that reflects the value of iStent to physicians, patients and to the healthcare system.
 The regulatory approval processes for our pipeline technologies remain on track, and moving forward. And we are well-positioned to expand our reach into targeted international markets. We continue to prove our ability to execute our strategy and claim an increasing share of the $5 billion global glaucoma market.
 Finally, we've added depth, capability, and strength, to a Senior Management Team that we believe will assure an enduring leadership position for Glaukos in the years ahead.
 So with that, I'll open up to questions. Operator?
